# LangTran Software Distribution System -- LTU-linux
## LangTran Updade method for Linux

These scripts depend on rsync to keep a software repository on your local computer up-to-date, and in sync with the international repository of the LangTran [Software Distribution System](http://lingtransoft.info/apps/langtran).

The packaging is as a .deb file for derivatives of Debian, but the individual files could be downloaded and should be usable on any Linux system, perhaps with some tweaking.
